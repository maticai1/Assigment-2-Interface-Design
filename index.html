          Making salsa lyrics with kilero pints<br>
          <span class="oleo">My life fits in 3 Rimowas, 2 LaCie and 1 pill box</span><br>
          Mine makes papeo while she smokes the culero<br>
          I could have 10 doctorates for how it gives brain<br>
          I'm in all my prayers,<br>
          I jumped in the Rover and went to see the conne'.<br>
          <span class="bowlby">He puts on Ruff Ryders to nerd out on pawn structures.</span><br>
          The motherfucker thinks he's on The Wire,<br>
          In the morning Harrods, in the evening baths<br>
          <span class="oleo">My love language is drool strings from my mouth to your pussy</span><br>
          Fufu, egusi, pussy, like with my hands<br>
          <span class="bowlby">Domis macheteros rapping on Jamaican rhythms (pu pu pu pu pu)</span><br>
          Il bacio de la morte<br>
          We rented a GLS 600 just for bouncing around<br>
          The power gets to her, I masturbate her while she eats<br>
          And that shit beeping, we don't wear seat belts<br>
          <span class="oleo">Take 10 pairs out of a 43</span><br>
          <span class="oleo">Roasting kid at the Korit√©</span><br>
          <span class="oleo">Wax cloth, Jordan breds</span><br>
          <span class="bowlby">Do the quest and go back to the kel with the gruyere</span><br>
          The corner of the page folded by Corintio<br>
          I teach her how to use the seafood tongs<br>
          Your plate gets cold because you're looking at mine<br>
          It's my brother's birthday, so it's also mine<br>
          Silence inside the vito<br>
          The chauffeur doesn't speak, the bouncers are frowning<br>
          You sense there's trouble but you only hear<br>
          <span class="bowlby">The distant murmur of his earpieces, pss pss, oh oh</span><br>
          <span class="bowlby">Flygod backing it up in the Whirlpool</span><br>
          <span class="bowlby">Fumes come out, I breathe them in, and I get yellow</span><br>
          <span class="bowlby">He sees me, he laughs, and gives a shot at the widow</span><br>
          <span class="bowlby">He's used to it, for him it's like cooking with a glass of wine</span>
